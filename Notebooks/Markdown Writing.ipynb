    "## Project Overview \n",
    "---\n",
    "This project was created as the capstone project for BrainStation's Data Science Diploma program.  The purpose of this project is to create a recommender algorithm for the Steam game store.  Specifically, this project seeks to create a recommender that is able to recognize early signs of success in the Indie (independent developer) game genre and predict whether a title will be successful, and if it is, recommend it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue in the gaming space is that indie developers often do not have strong budgets to market their games, often forced to spend it all on development.  This makes it difficult for them to reach potential buyers, often relying on free social media marketing and community influence to get the word out.  Despite this, indie games have had many examples of runaway success.  So much so that there has been a marked shift of trust of the gaming community from established game development studios to new indie studios, marking a gaming renaissance of sorts.  That being said there are all too many examples of game finishing development and lying dormant for long periods of time until a player with a strong community following plays it and revitalizes the entire project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this algorithm is to hopefully streamline the discovery process. To boost games that it determines has strong potential for success in the market that may not otherwise receive any attention. \n",

    "## Data Source\n",
    "---\n",
    "The version of the dataset that was used for this project can be downloaded [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uAk0yDECBKfU1yI5PucsgsySShJ4tyFc/view?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets were sourced from Kaggle, the original poster specified a monthly update frequency so you can potentially source an updated dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam)\n",

    "## Data Breakdown\n",
    "---\n",
    "The file consists of three separates csv's and a JSON file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "games.csv features a breakdown of all the games available for sale in the Steam store.  The intial csv contains basic data that could create a base recommender system.  The JSON file included however contains additional, non tabular, information on games such as descriptions and tags.  For our purposes we will have to extract and connect at least some of that information to this file.  \n",

    "Column breakdown of games.csv is as follows:\n",
